Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Regarding Software Factory:

* We continued the work on tenant (zuul-less) and external gerrit (gerrit-less) deployment mode. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDfXrfK_nThWzxYo_Hv-i8DqSGNcyK9z/view?usp=sharing
* We added python-openshift client to the SCL.
* We worked on anomaly detection in triple-o ci jobs, example report: http://38.145.32.112/logreduce/d3a45f7.html
* We finalize reviews to allow operator to change the fdqn for a deployment (configuration, ci job and documentation).
* We fixed a configuration issue with the new version of telegraf, all our configuration is now stored in /etc/telegraf.d.
* We've fixed a problem with the SAML configuration at upgrade time
* We're fixing an error in sfconfig when using a "known gerrit" configuration (this is still in progress)
* Some progress with user backend + cauth integration (I was able to deploy a standalone cauth) User auth in repoxplorer via cauth and the new cauth's repoxplorer driver register its emails to repoxplorer User backend. (Can be re-used into a SF deployment)

Regarding our contributions to Zuul and Nodepool:

* We worked on adding Project Test Interface documentation to Zuul.
