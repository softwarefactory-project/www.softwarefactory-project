The latest version 7.7 of CentOS has been released and some fixes has
been integrated in SF-3.2 and SF-3.3 to properly support this new version.

Please update the sf-release and sf-config package before doing an update.

The next version of Software Factory will benefit from the new python3
system package provided by CentOS which will simplify the migration to
CentOS 8.
