Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* Fabien zuul report driver for Elasticsearch is almost merged in community! (we will be able to create visualization with job duration in Kibana)

* We worked on the Zuul scheduler HA feature and helped on replacing the fedora-30 labels by f32

* Zuul-client corrective release 0.0.2 is out, the package is now installable from PYPI

* We worked on enabling functional testing on zuul-client with zuul

* We worked on new features for zuul-client: encrypt, build/buildset list and show, console-stream

* We did upstream review of GitLab Zuul driver (multiple patches from a real user)


Software Factory
----------------

* We improved the purgelogs script and made it a standalone project: https://softwarefactory-project.io/cgit/software-factory/purgelogs/tree/

* We investigated web technologies to replace the existing welcome page

* We validated behavior and Landed Gerrit 3.2 in sf master

* We experiemented with the check API of Gerrit + Zuul but gave up as the support is partial and won't allow us to remove the use of ssh stream

* We almost finished changing the Elasticsearch stack to Opendistro
