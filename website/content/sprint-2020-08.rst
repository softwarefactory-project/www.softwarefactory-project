Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.


Opendev
-------

* We reported and validated a critical fix for the Zuul scheduler

* We have proposed some patches on Zuul to improve the GitLab driver: push, tag support + depends-on support. The documentation has been proposed as well. We have managed to include some people interested about the driver.

* [Demo] We've worked on some Quality-of-Life patches for Zuul and the web UI:

* Filter/display builds depending on whether they're held or not

* Display autohold requests

* Allow filtering of nodes by label, provider, state and time spent in state

* [Demo] We've restarted work on authentication in the UI from scratch:

* Support for tenant-scoped identity providers

* How-Tos explaining how to configure Zuul with google Auth or keycloak for user authentication

* Dequeues can be triggered from the status page

* We proposed to split the zuul CLI to be usable by tenant admin


Software Factory
----------------

* We have validated and merged the dhall-nodepool integration in sf-config

* We discussed the next step for SoftwareFactory 3.5 release and future roadmap: https://softwarefactory-project.io/etherpad/p/sf-3.5

* We fixed zuul console streaming when running jobs in container

* We configured prometheus monitoring for zuul queue length and nodepool image age

* we setup udp-multiplexer on our sf infra - works well (it redirect nodepool statsd metrics to multiple destination hosts)

* we patched repoxplorer so now is also supporting Elasticsearch 7.X

* we've added testing for upgrades and migration from cauth to keycloak (they're failing for now!)
