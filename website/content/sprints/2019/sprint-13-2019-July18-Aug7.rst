Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

**Regarding our contributions to Zuul and Nodepool:**

* We got most of the JWT patch chain merged. The GUI part is going to take some time.
* We added a review documenting the protected REST API in the OpenAPI format. The formatting could be problematic and might require additional work.
* We helped with integration testing of the zuul-operator upstream.
