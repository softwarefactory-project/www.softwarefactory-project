Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We propose "logsender" service that will be parsing log results fetched by Logscraper and send it to the Elasticsearch service. It change the log processing workflow by removing gearman-client, gearman-worker and logstash service

* We are adding more documentation into ci log processing repository

* We submitted some fixes to zuul's web UI that we noticed when upgrading to zuul 5:

* Fix broken enqueue when buildset.newrev is null https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/830846

* Hide Sign-In button if no Identity Provider is available https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/831222

* Insist in documentation about adding a default HS256 authenticator to maintain CLI usefulness https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/831231

* We proposed more authentication methods for zuul-client:

* basic auth https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul-client/+/819118

* web auth https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul-client/+/831946

* We worked on adding a quick tenant selector on the GUI for non-whitelabeled deployments; this requires caching the tenants list in the API

* We added support for `[K` and `[m` escape code in zuul console output: https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/re-ansi/+/24175


Software Factory
----------------

* We investigated how to avoid extra user uid for the container by using uidmap.

* We are working on SF 3.7 release and here the stories finished during the sprint:

    * We removed the patches action from sf-container role now we build our own zuul and nodepool containers

    * We updated zuul-jobs package

    * We updated managesf (which create hound configuration) and fixed zuul configuration to redirect to gitiles

    * We run all containerized services with service user instead root

    * We removed repoxplorer bits from managesf for the service is now deprecated

    * We added documentation for operator to manage containers https://softwarefactory-project.io/cgit/software-factory/sf-docs/tree/docs/operator/deepdive.rst#n111

    * We upgraded and containerized etherpad
