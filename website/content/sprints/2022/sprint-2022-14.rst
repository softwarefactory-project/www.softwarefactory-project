Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We added a feature for logscraper that it should not quit the service when zuul api is not reachable

Software Factory
----------------

next sf release (sf-3.8)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We bumped zuul version to 7.1.0

* We updated the sf-ui to adapt to Keycloak

* We worked on tracking issues with SF-CI to remove flakyness

* We worked on switching from cauth to keycloak, various fixes along the way to opensearch, grafana, managesf

* We updated the Landing Page icons for Keycloak and Opensearch Dashboards

SF-operator (sf-4.0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We added Managesf, Hound, GerritBot, Cgit, Postfix and Grafana Operators

* We started improving roles by adding securityContext or move some containers that were using "root" as a user that later would be easier to move the CI to Openshift
