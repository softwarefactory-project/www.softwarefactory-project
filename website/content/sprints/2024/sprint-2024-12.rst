Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We added a url subpath to support opensearch endpoints that contains subdir, for example: localhost/opensearch in ci-log-processing project
* We added a patch to pass the CI for OpenSearch 2.13 and OpenSearch Dashboards 2.13 in ci-log-processing project
* We reviewed the zuul-operator fixes.

Software Factory
----------------

* We worked on integrating zuul-weeder and LogJuicer into the sf-operator
* We added dhall, dhall-json and /var/cache/dhall on zuul-executor image for dhall-diff job
* We increased etcd ramdisk size to 1g because 512m was not enough
* We removed restartPolicy parameter for init containers becasue MicroShift 4.16 was complaing about it
* We tested a sf-operator with MicroShift 4.16 and we proposed a patch to move to that version as default (it is a LTS release)
