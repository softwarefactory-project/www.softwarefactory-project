Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

opendev
-------

* We discussed zuul-operator implementation with upstream and finally agree on: https://review.opendev.org/#/c/705535/3/CONTRIBUTE.md
* We worked on making zuul-jobs compatible with kubectl connection
* We had improvements to the openidconnect driver merged
* We worked on adding templating in the admin rules: the keyword {TENANT} can be used in rules definitions and replaced by the context's tenant when checking authZ rules.


Software Factory
----------------

* we worked on preparing managesf for integration with keycloak:
* we removed all old code related to Storyboard
* we investigated mod_auth_openidc
* we've packaged yaml-cpp since this dependency was missing after discarding ROD's openstack repositories
* we're preparing managesf for a seamless switch from cauth to keycloak
* we discussed sf-3.5 roadmap to better integrate with the new sf-infra system as well as an eventual sf-operator
