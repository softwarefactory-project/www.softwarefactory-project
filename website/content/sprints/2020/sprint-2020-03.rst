Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

opendev
-------

* We found a security issue in Zuul: https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul-security-fix-add-host.html

* We worked on integrating the zuul-registry into the zuul-operator

* We participated in the Zuul User Survey design


Software Factory
----------------

* We added port-forward to k1s service to implement zuul console stream from pod

* We tested clean-check removal from zuul pipeline with good success

* We've continued to work on keycloak integration, replacement for SF cauth:

  * keycloak RPM updated to 9.0.0

  * manageSF: the REST API is protected by mod_auth_openidc & the resources engine can fetch a JWT to authenticate on a remote manageSF

  * sfmanager: the CLI can fetch a JWT on keycloak & user related commands are deactivated if keycloak is the SSO

  * grafana: user login via keycloak

  * gerrit: after investigating the REST API auth, I feel the best solution is just to enable the default flow, ie allow users to set API password in settings.

  * next steps: repoxplorer integration, SSH keys sync, Zuul GUI, multi tenant deployment support (TBD)
