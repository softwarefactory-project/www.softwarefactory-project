Below are the tasks we worked on during our last 2 weeks sprint:

* We're working on a Proof-of-Concept Zuul Web Admin
* We've finalize the script to automatically generate Zuul and Nodepool dashboards. We updated softwarefactory-project.io to validate grafs with real data (https://softwarefactory-project.io/grafana/?orgId=1 ). We also added in the config repo a metric directory to allow users to add custom dashboards.
* We have published a first version http://www.softwarefactory-project.io using CI/CD via the pages feature
* We have integrated last repoxplorer version 1.2.0 to SF
* We have enabled two periodic jobs to validate SF install (last stable) on centos and centos CR
* We have moved the SF backup node on the private PCTT cloud
* We deployed a real pre-production called trysf.io to validate the 2.7->3.0 (candidate) upgrade and we upgraded the production deploymented: new zuul dashboard, new statsd metrics and elk stash working with zuulv3 jobs
* A patch letting operators define a default maximum holding time for nodepool was merged upstream: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/536295/
* Addressed an issue that crashed ARA during devstack runs: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/546029/
* Patch to improve zuul loading speed merged https://review.openstack.org/#/c/535509/
* Worked on making zuul compatible with Ansible 2.4, ended up create a backport to 2.4: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36572
