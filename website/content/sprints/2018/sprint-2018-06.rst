Below are the tasks we worked on during our last 2 weeks sprint:

* We have played around with Kerberos, leading to the grooming of a future implementation: https://tree.taiga.io/project/morucci-software-factory/epic/951
* We have move the resources engine API under the new managesf API v2 endpoint
* We have investigated a solution to make the resources engine apply call asynchronuous and discuss with team and finally decided a new solution w/o passing through the manageSF API
* We have changed the sf-ops backup playbook to facilitate old backup deletion with bup.
* We have boostrapped a website for Software Factory with static pages and blog based on pelican https://softwarefactory-project.io/logs/71/11171/6/check/build-pages/1b4a02a/pages/
* We investigated gerrit-2.14 integration, though database schema changed and managesf/initialization needs to be adapted to use the REST api
* We integrated ara in sfconfig so that all ansible-playbook execution are stored
* We removed zuulV2/nodepoolV2 and Jenkins and dropped the version prefix in zuul/nodepool.
* We updated the zuul and nodepool package to use the new Javascript tooling stack.
* We added dynamic collections of zuul and nodepool configuration to generate grafana dashboard.
* We abandoned the graphite integration to avoid to have two metrics backends in SF. We started to prepare a script to automatically generate nodepool and zuul graph based on yaml file.
