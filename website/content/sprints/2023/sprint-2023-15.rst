Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We proposed zuul jobs roles to run LogJuicer: https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul-jobs/+/899212

Software Factory
----------------

* We Migrated Software Factory project CI Jobs from sf.io to micro.sf.io

* We changed some GitHub connection parameters to kubernetes secrets ( previously they were set in the SF CR )

* We have added GitLab connection support to Zuul Connections in sf-operator

* We set Golang Environment Variable due to an update in golang 1.21

* We are working on a MariaDB Container based on UBI 9 Image

* We investigated Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Scaling to implement it sf-operator project:
  * Added Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to Zuul Executor
  * Add metrics-server to CI jobs
  * Add metrics-server stress test

* We added the zuul pub key to nodepool-builder https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-operator/+/29786

* We resized nodepool-builder /var/lib/nodepool https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-operator/+/29785

* We wrote nodepool-builder ADR https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-operator/+/29797

* We prevented .ssh/known_hosts to be wiped https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-operator/+/29812

* We added a standalone mode for sf-operator https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/q/topic:standalone+repo:software-factory/sf-operator without cluster admin

* we started work on providing an alternative for log collection with zuul & nodepool, based on Fluent Bit. (Demo maybe)

* We're publishing our docs automatically on github.io, API documentation is autogenerated as well (Demo for sure)

* We are working on merging the dev and standalone mode:
  * dev = operator straight from the source, just "go run"
  * standalone is not using CR, just plain config, w/o cluster admin
