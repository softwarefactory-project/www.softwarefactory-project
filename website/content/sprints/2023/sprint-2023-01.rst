Below are the tasks we worked on during our last sprint.

Opendev
-------

* We fixed issue in logscraper, that it was not downloading important files from the logserver (zuul-info/inventory.yaml), so the logsender was skipping the log directory

* We added a OpenSearch Dashboards script thas is base on the script that we have in Software Factory project, but with few featues, for example: added support for AWS OpenSearch Dashboards

* We set tags permissions for openstack/ci-log-processing project, so we will be ready to make a release after merging all content that is in review state

* We splitted variables related to the ca certificates for logscraper and logsender because they might not use same CA provider

Software Factory
----------------

next sf release (sf-3.8)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We removed all keycloak's conditionals and cauth mentions

* We fixed Gerrit container 3.5.4 reviewers-by-blame plugin and added zuul-results-summary plugin

* We fixed highlight Cgit feature

* We updated SF documentation for 3.8 release

* sf-docs : We removed an option from sfconfig command: provision-demo

* We set several containers to user a dedicated user instead of root

* We fixed some obsolete auth parameters being injected in sfconfig.yaml (remnants from previous upgrades sanitizing) when upgrading to 3.8

* We validated various patches and did some manual testing for the 3.8 release https://softwarefactory-project.io/etherpad/p/3.8_changes

* We started the release process of 3.8 and got a candidate
