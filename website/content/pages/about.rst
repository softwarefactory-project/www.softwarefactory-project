**Software Factory** (also called SF) is a software development forge.
Software Factory provides an easy way to get everything you need to host,
design, modify, test and build softwares; all of this pre-configured and
usable immediately. Software Factory relies on several main components
like Zuul_, Nodepool_, Gerrit_ to provide powerful Continuous Integration
and developement workflows.
