What is the added value of Software Factory ?
---------------------------------------------

If you are not sure about using Software Factory, here are some perks that might
convince you:

* Software Factory is a Continuous Integration system that works out of the box, with everything ready to be used right after the first configuration run.
  Deploying all the services by hand and with this level of interdependency would take a lot more time.
* Software Factory helps enforcing the latest best practices in Continuous Integration.
* In Software Factory, the configuration is treated as code that can therefore be versioned, reviewed, tested or rolled back for any change.
* Users are automatically and consistently authenticated on each service with Single Sign-On. Again, achieving this by hand would be very time consuming.
* Software Factory can be fully backed up, restored, and upgraded automatically through tested processes.
* Software Factory can be deployed anywhere: baremetal systems, LXC, KVM or on OpenStack via Heat.
* Software Factory is fast to deploy (3/5 minutes on a local system, 15 minutes with Heat).
* Software Factory runs worker nodes on demand on an OpenStack cloud, which can reduce effective costs of testing.
