Software Factory (also called SF) is a collection of services that provides
a powerful platform to build software. It's optimized to
use an OpenStack-based cloud for resources, but this is not mandatory at all.

Setting up a full software development stack manually can really be
time-consuming. Software Factory provides an easy way to get everything you need to host,
design, modify, test and build software; all of this pre-configured
and usable immediately.

Software Factory feature also features automated upgrades, so you don't have to
worry about upgrading each services yourself.
